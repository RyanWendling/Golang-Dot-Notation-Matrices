# Golang-Dot-Notation-Matrices
Perform dot notation on two matrices using Go

*Coded using Cloud9 IDE.

To run the program, call "go run dotProductRW.go" in your terminal/IDE of choice. The program will then ask for the name of 
the first matrix file and then the name of the second matrix file. The program will then attempt to open these files using
the names provided by the user. The program will then print the contents of these matrices along with the matching lengths that form 
the basis of our new matrix. Assuming the dimensions match. The program will print the contents of the new matrix after dot notation 
has been performed. The program will then close.
